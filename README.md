This is a project I completed as part of the summer class CS540: Intro to AI at the University of Wisconsin. This code is used Breadth First Search (BFS) 
to solve a 57x58 maze from https://www.mazegenerator.net/. It takes a .png file as the input and outputs both a recreation of the maze as a .txt file, and 
also a solution to the maze as a .txt file.
